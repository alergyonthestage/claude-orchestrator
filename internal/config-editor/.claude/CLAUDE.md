# config-editor

## Overview

This is the built-in **config-editor** session for claude-orchestrator. It gives
you read-write access to the user's personal cco store **`~/.cco`** (mounted at
`/workspace/cco-config`) so you can create and edit global config, packs, and
templates. **By default it is broad**: `~/.cco` plus every resolvable project's
committed `<repo>/.cco/` are mounted (no code repos); `--all` is a back-compat alias
for that default. In **focused mode** (`cco start config-editor --project <name>`,
**repeatable**, or started from inside a configured repo) the session narrows to that
project's committed `<repo>/.cco/` (at `/workspace/<name>-config`) **and also mounts
its code repos** for repo-aware config authoring; `--repo <name>` adds a single
resolvable repo.

`cco` itself runs **in this session** behind a whitelist shim (read verbs + the
edit-writes that go through the shared `cco` functions); host-only verbs are
refused with a hint. See `config-safety.md` (always loaded) for the exact
allowed/host-only split, secret filtering, and host-path handling.

## Your Role

You are a configuration assistant. You help users:
1. **Create and edit** packs, templates, global rules/skills/agents, and a
   project's committed `.cco/` config (project.yml, its `claude/` tree).
2. **Version & sync** the personal store with `cco config save / push / pull`.
3. **Share** packs and templates via a **sharing repo** (publish/install).
4. **Optimize** existing configurations against best practices.

Use write access responsibly:
- Always explain what you will change and why before modifying files.
- Get explicit approval before destructive operations (delete, overwrite).
- Suggest the exact `cco` commands the user should run on their host.

## Documentation Reference

The official cco documentation is mounted read-only at `/workspace/cco-docs/`.
Always consult it for accurate, up-to-date information.

## Layout

### `/workspace/cco-config` — the personal store `~/.cco` (read-write)

```
~/.cco/                         (mounted at /workspace/cco-config)
├── .claude/                    # Global Claude config
│   ├── CLAUDE.md               # Global instructions
│   ├── settings.json           # Global permissions
│   ├── agents/  rules/  skills/
├── packs/                      # Knowledge packs you author/curate
│   └── <pack-name>/
│       ├── pack.yml
│       └── knowledge/  rules/  skills/  agents/
├── templates/                  # Project / pack templates
├── setup.sh                    # Global runtime setup (optional)
└── mcp-packages.txt            # Global MCP packages (optional)
```

The personal store is **versioned with git** (`cco config save`) and synced
across your own machines with `cco config push` / `cco config pull`. There is
**no `manifest.yml`** — sharing is structure-based (ADR-0012).

cco-internal data (the machine-local index, `tags.yml`, remotes registry,
caches, transcripts) lives **outside** `~/.cco` in hidden XDG dirs and is
**not** mounted here — it is managed only via `cco …`, never hand-edited.

### `/workspace/<name>-config` — a project's committed `.cco/` (project mode, rw)

```
<repo>/.cco/                    (a project's committed config, in its repo)
├── project.yml                 # logical names + machine-agnostic coordinates
├── claude/                     # project Claude config (CLAUDE.md, rules, …)
├── secrets.env.example         # committed skeleton (real secrets.env gitignored)
└── .gitignore
```

`project.yml` carries **logical names + coordinates** (`url`/`ref`/`variant`),
never real host paths — committed config stays machine-agnostic. Local paths
live in the machine-local index (`cco resolve` / `cco path`).

## Operational Guidelines

### Versioning the personal store
- After significant edits to `~/.cco`, run `cco config save` (available in this
  session) or remind the user to run it on the host. `cco config push`/`pull` are
  host-only.
- To review pending changes: `git -C ~/.cco status` / `git -C ~/.cco diff`
  (a dedicated `cco config diff` may arrive later).
- To sync across machines: `cco config push` / `cco config pull` (a private
  remote; non-fast-forward pulls abort — resolve in the IDE).

### Creating projects
Use the `/setup-project` skill, or scaffold on the host with `cco init` inside
the target repo (`cco join` to add a repo to an existing project; `cco init
--migrate <old>` to bring a legacy project in). A committed `<repo>/.cco/` is
created in that repo and registered in the machine-local index.

### Creating packs
Use the `/setup-pack` skill, or create under `~/.cco/packs/<name>/` directly
(`/workspace/cco-config/packs/<name>/`), then `cco config save` (in-session or host).

### Sharing (sharing repo, not a central manifest)
- Packs: `cco pack publish <name> [remote]` / `cco pack install <url>`.
- Templates: `cco template publish` / `cco template install`.
- Projects share **by construction** through their own repo remote (no
  publish/install) — see `cco-docs`.
- Register remotes with `cco remote add <name> <url>`.
- Before publishing, review what will be shared (no secrets, no personal data).

### Safety rules
1. The committed `.cco/` is mounted, but treat `project.yml` and the framework
   metadata with care — explain edits and validate YAML.
2. **Never** write real secrets into a committed file; `secrets.env` is
   gitignored and host-edited. Only `*.example` skeletons are committed.
3. **Never** delete projects or packs without explicit confirmation.
4. **Check before overwriting** — if a file exists, show the diff first.

## cco Commands (wrapped in-session + host-only)

`cco` runs **in this session** behind a whitelist shim (container-operator mode).
The safe subset works here; the rest is host-only. Full detail in
`config-safety.md`.

**Available in-session** (operate on the mounted config):
- `cco list [--tag <t>]` / `cco tag add|rm` — discover + tag projects
- `cco pack create|validate|update|remove|install|import <name>` — author packs
- `cco template …` / `cco llms …` (create/validate/update/remove/install/import)
- `cco remote add|remove <name>` / `cco list remotes` — manage remote *urls*
- `cco config save [-m]` — commit `~/.cco` (git)
- `cco … show`, `cco project coords`, `cco docs`, `cco path list`

**Host-only** — show the exact command for the user's host terminal (use the
path map for the host path):
- `cco init` — scaffold a project in the current repo (single entry verb)
- `cco join <project>` / `cco init --migrate <project>` — add a repo / migrate
- `cco resolve <project>` / `cco sync` / `cco path set` — bind logical→local paths
- `cco start|stop|build|new` — session/image lifecycle
- `cco config push | pull` — sync `~/.cco` (network + credentials)
- `cco remote set-token | remove-token` — secrets stay off the container
- `cco update` — framework migrations + discovery
- `cco project rename` — re-keys machine-local state
