# P5 handoff — Sharing-ext + the deferred verbs — the final v1 phase

Self-contained launcher for a **clean session** (open after `/clear`) to build the rest of **Phase 5** —
the deferred-to-v1 command surface (lifecycle verbs, three-layer pack resolution, validation, protect)
on the Phase-4 substrate. The build P0–P4 + P4-doc are done; the schema bridge is collapsed to
index-only; the vault is gone; **the central `$PROJECTS_DIR`/`CCO_*_DIR` layout is gone too (P5-1)**. What
remains is the §3 lifecycle/sharing-ext command surface.

Branch `feat/vault/decentralized-config`, commits **LOCAL** (the maintainer pushes from the Mac).

## ⏩ RESUME STATUS (read this FIRST)

> **✅ PHASES 0–4 CLOSED + P5-0/P5-1 DONE (2026-06-25). ▶ RESUME AT P5-2.** The §1 boundary audit ran

> `0da6153` (pure project.yml readers → STATE index) · P5-1b-2 `6209bae` (`cco clean` → index + artifacts

**Suite 828/0** — delta-green is measured against **ZERO** failures (any failure = regression). Run with
the hatch: `CCO_ALLOW_HOST_RESOLVE=1 ./bin/test` (`--file <name>` / `--filter <substr>` to scope).

**The `decentralized-config` design is the single SOURCE OF TRUTH**, precedence:
`guiding-principles.md` (P1–P18) → ADRs (0005–0027) → living `design.md` → `requirements.md`. The more
specific/authoritative wins; **record any reconciliation**; a genuine design gap ⇒ **PAUSE and discuss**.

**First actions (resume):** (1) `git log --oneline -15` + read the live progress note
`decentralized-config-impl-progress.md` (cursor: P5-1 done; **P5-2 scope + call-sites** at the tail);
(2) re-confirm baseline **828/0**; (3) **skip §1 (audit consumed) — start P5-2** (§3 below); per §0,
**propose the sub-commit decomposition to the maintainer before coding.**

---

## 0. Authoritative methodology (the law — unchanged across the whole refactor)

- **Design governs.** Precedence as above. The build realizes the frozen design; it does not invent.
- **Build method** (Cluster-2 directive): **dependency + reuse + open-closed**, **build-once-in-final-form**,
  **breaking cutover** (no dual-read; ~2 known users). Removed verbs get **no alias** unless an ADR says so
  (**AD12**).
- **Delta-green per commit.** Each commit leaves cco runnable and the suite at the 1 known failure (no new
  reds). Decompose a co-dependent cutover into a few **large coordinated commits**.
- **Maintainer-confirm** any UX / interface / placement / sequencing choice (AskUserQuestion). Propose the
  sub-commit decomposition + any open reconciliations **before** coding.
- **Code-ground every claim** (re-read; line numbers drift). **bash 3.2 / macOS** (`/bin/bash`, guard empty
  arrays under `set -u`).
- **Self-development caveat:** edits to `config/`, `Dockerfile`, baked `defaults/managed/**` are NOT live
  this session (need `cco build`); `lib/`, `internal/`, `templates/`, `docs/` ARE host-side and testable now.
- **Lesson carried from P4-5c:** "bridge-fed" / "consumer of a removed thing" includes **runtime generators**
  (e.g. the config-editor project.yml) and **end-to-end tests whose name doesn't say so** (test_yaml_parser
  was full of `cco start` mount tests) — not just inline `create_project` fixtures. When you remove a code
  path, grep for *generators* and *e2e assertions*, not only direct callers.

## 1. The adherence-audit playbook (boundary check) — P4→P5 audit ✅ CONSUMED

> **✅ The P4→P5 boundary audit is DONE — `reviews/24-06-2026-p4-p5-adherence-review.md`** (Phase-4 fully
> conformant, 0 code 🔴). **A resuming session SKIPS this section and starts P5-2 (§3).** The playbook below
> is retained as the recurring reference for the **next** boundary (the P5→merge audit, §5). Baseline **828/0**.

Run the recurring **`implementation-review-handoff.md`** playbook (read-only, code-grounded, 4-state
classify ✅conformant/❌missing/🟡hybrid-intentional/🔴hybrid-error; the V multi-agent methodology, scaled to
the phase). Confirm before building P5:

1. **Baseline 827/1** by direct `--file` runs — the 1 = the P5 llms straddler, no 2nd regression.
2. **Phase-4 conformance** — sharing core (P4-1…P4-4) + the teardown (P4-5a/b/c) + P4-doc match design §6.2/§7/
   §9-P4 + ADRs 0018/0019/0022/0023; the schema bridge is index-only (no `@local`/`yml_get_repos` left);
   `cco config save/push/pull` + `cco tag` + sharing 2×2 conformant.
3. **Transitional Registry refresh** — most items are now RETIRED (vault, @local, tier-2 verbs, schema bridge,
   legacy parsers). What REMAINS transitional ⇒ the **P4-5d set**: harness dual-seed + legacy `CCO_*_DIR` in
   `bin/cco`, and the central `$PROJECTS_DIR/*/` enumeration in ~10 commands (`cmd-update`/`cmd-llms`/`cmd-pack`/
   `cmd-template`/`cmd-clean`/`cmd-chrome`/`cmd-stop`/`cmd-start:~1149`/`cmd-project-query`). Confirm no PREMATURE
   P5 cleanup happened.
4. **Doc-coherence** — shipped-behavior docs not rewritten ahead of code (the §6 commands below are mostly
   marked 🚧 planned in cli.md/configuration-management until built).

Commit the review under `reviews/` (e.g. `reviews/DD-06-2026-impl-adherence-review.md`) + refresh the
Transitional Registry + roadmaps. **If 0 🔴 / 0 blockers → Phase 4 CLOSED; proceed to P5. Else PAUSE + discuss.**

## 2. Context to load (reading order)

1. `guiding-principles.md` (**P1–P18**).
2. **This file.**
3. The live progress note **`decentralized-config-impl-progress.md`** (cursor: P5-1 done; **P5-2 scope + call-sites** at the tail) + `git log`.
4. `design.md` **§9** (the P0–P5 phase map + per-phase test contracts; §11) and **§12** (deferred-post-v1: state-sync / local-llms / Case-C / namespacing) + the ADRs per item below.
5. `implementation-review-handoff.md` — the recurring audit playbook + the **Transitional Registry** (P0–P4 + P4-5d now retired).
6. The code (re-grep — line numbers drift).

## 3. Scope — Phase 5 (the §6 deferred list, on the P4 substrate)

> **✅ BUILD ORDER CONFIRMED (maintainer):** P5-0 llms-fix ✅ → **P5-1** P4-5d teardown ✅ → **▶ P5-2**
> `cco forget` + `cco config validate` → **P5-3** three-layer pack resolution + `internalize` +
> `export --bundle-packs` → **P5-4** `cco project validate` + `cco project coords` → **P5-5**
> `cco update --check` → **P5-6** `cco config protect` → **P5-doc** (remove the 🚧 markers as each ships) →
> **pre-merge dogfooding**. **Index per-project namespacing = POST-V1** (confirmed; global-flat stays,
> ADR-0022 D2). Per-unit: code-ground fresh (line numbers drift), decompose into sub-commits, confirm
> micro-UX with the maintainer, delta-green each commit.

Each item is its own dependency-ordered unit; **propose the sub-commit decomposition to the maintainer
before coding** (per §0). Remaining units:

- **P4-5d — central-layout → index teardown. ✅ DONE (P5-1, 2026-06-25).** Every command enumerates via the
  STATE index; `$PROJECTS_DIR`/`CCO_PROJECTS_DIR` + the bin/cco legacy branch + the harness dual-seed are
  gone; `cco update`'s project loop reads `<repo>/.cco/claude` and new projects are born-at-latest. Suite 828/0.
- **▶ P5-2 — `cco forget` + `cco config validate`** (ADR-0021). `cco forget <project>` deregisters a project's
  id-keyed internal state (index paths+projects entry · `tags.yml` · STATE `projects/<id>/` · DATA
  `projects/<id>/`) — **repo untouched**; index self-heals via cwd-first + `resolve --scan`. Today
  `bin/cco:~203` `die`s "ships in a later release" (replace). `cco config validate [--fix]` = orphan-prune
  (EXPLICIT/preview-first/**NEVER** automatic; F59 delete-cascade pack/template/llms/remote); today
  `cmd-config.sh:~172` `die`s (replace). Both marked 🚧 planned in cli.md §3.4b/§3.21 + configuration-management.md
  — remove the 🚧 as each ships (P5-doc-style, shipped-behavior). **The detailed P5-2 scope is at the tail of
  the live progress note.**
- **`cco project validate`** full share-readiness contract (ADR-0023 D2): cwd-first, exit 0/1/2, ERE
  machine-agnostic, presence-only + `--reachable`, detect-only/never-block, carries the ADR-0022 D4 pack
  no-coord ERROR row. (cli.md §3.14 holds the target surface, currently marked 🚧 planned.)
- **`cco update --check`** (DATA-source-driven + install-presence-gated 3-state, exit-0; ADR-0022 D6).
- **Three-layer pack resolution + `internalize`** (ADR-0019 D3/D7, ADR-0023 D4): mount local-first
  `~/.cco/packs` → url → `<repo>/.cco/packs` cache; `internalize` = pack/template cut-url v1 + `--as` fork
  (project Case-C is name-reserved post-v1); `export --bundle-packs`. Plus the orphaned `_resolve_template_vars`
  full `{{VAR}}` resolution for `cco init --template` adapted to the new `claude/` layout.
- **`cco project coords`** (cross-unit ADR-0016 D3, on-demand coords-lookup) + **`cco config protect`** helper
  (docs-only v1 today; ADR-0020 D4 / F27 pinned contract).
- **index per-project namespacing** (ADR-0022 D2 — global-flat ratified for v1; namespacing post-v1) — confirm
  whether v1 or post-v1.
- **T = state-sync** (DATA/STATE cross-PC sync engine) — **post-v1**, owned by T; do NOT build in P5 unless
  the maintainer pulls it in.

## 4. Cross-cutting invariants (never violate)

- **4-bucket taxonomy** (ADR-0007/0015/0016): CONFIG `~/.cco` · DATA `~/.local/share/cco` (synced) · STATE
  `~/.local/state/cco` (machine-local: index, base/+meta, tokens, memory/transcripts) · CACHE (regenerable).
- **The STATE index is the sole name→path map** (the schema bridge is collapsed; no `@local`, no
  `local-paths.yml`, no `path:` in project.yml). **AD3/G8 — no real host path ever enters committed config.**
- **P13** projects ride the code-repo remote. **P14** reachability is layered + never a hard block.
  **Host-side resolver guard (H4)** + the **compose↔entrypoint container-path contract** are invariants.

## 5. Pre-merge to develop/main (the gate)

Full **dogfooding e2e on the Mac** (`P2-dogfooding-validation.md` §3) on a vault **copy** with sandboxed roots
(`CCO_USER_CONFIG_DIR` + `CCO_{DATA,STATE,CACHE}_HOME` + HOME-flip). **Never accept the legacy-vault
offer-to-remove until merged + validated.** After P5, the refactor is v1-complete — reconcile both roadmaps
(global `docs/maintainer/decisions/roadmap.md` + `analysis-roadmap.md`) and mark the ADRs.

> Next free ADR = **0028**. Live cursor = `decentralized-config-impl-progress.md`. The per-phase scaffold
> handoffs (P1/P2/P3/P3b/P3cd/P3-5/P4/P4-5) **and `Y-handoff-implementation.md`** (its launch purpose is
> consumed; the build method lives in §0 here, the P0–P5 phase map in `design.md` §9, the deferred-post-v1
> list in `design.md` §12) were consumed and removed — content in the progress note + git history. Recurring
> audit playbook = `implementation-review-handoff.md`; pre-release validation = `P2-dogfooding-validation.md`.
